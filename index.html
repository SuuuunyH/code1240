		<div class="content">My movie is arrival, this film is based on the introduction of 12 mysterious alien spaceships on the earth. The "Advent" is not the only way for aliens to invade the earth. According to the Chinese sci-fi writer Ted Ginger short science fiction novel The adaptation of the story of your life gives this work a novel perspective. The plot outlined by the charm of language, the exploration of time and life, has become the highlight of the film.

			<div class="content_two">Overall, I designed it to be streamlined, and the shape looks like the outer shell of a spaceship, to match the technological sense of the film. I chose to put it in the whole building, which is in line with the inclusiveness of the language in the film.

		<div class="title_one">Design concept</div>
		<div class="content">With the development of modern cities, people's demand for housing is getting higher and higher. Market demand determines the development trend of the housing industry. There are many differences in society. Of course, housing demand is different, and residential development with diversity and appropriate personality is needed. With the rapid development of the modern film industry, film has become one of the important occasions for people to relax, entertain and consume. So I think it would be nice to put these two together.

		<div class="content_three">A qualified building should first consider safety issues, I set up a large area of space around the cinema, if the fire and other security problems happened we can effectively and quickly escape. Usually this place can also be used to queue tickets, will not be crowded

My solution to this is to wrap the entire house with soundproofing and noise-reducing wooden materials, minimizing the impact of noise on the residents</div>
